# Todo App

This is a simple Todo application built with Next.js and TypeScript.

Todos are persisted in your browser's local storage so you won't lose them on refresh.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the app.

## GitHub Pages

A simple static page is provided under the `docs/` folder. To publish it on GitHub Pages:

1. Push this repository to GitHub.
2. In the repository settings, enable **GitHub Pages** and choose the `main` branch and `docs/` folder as the source.
3. Save the settings and your page will be available at `https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`.
